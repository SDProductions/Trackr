# Trackr
100% Client-based time tracking application.

Have you ever used, or considered using a time-management application, but have a relatively low-performing device or network? Introducing Trackr! Trackr is a 100% client-based time-management app that never connects to your internet at all. Ever worried about companies taking personal information, or using what you put into their application to sell to third parties? Worry no more, at least when using your trusty time management software.

Trackr is still in active development and does have some issues and essential features lacking - if this turns you away for now, check back later as we will have likely made progress!
