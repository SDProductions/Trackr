# Trackr

<b>Do you suck at time management?</b>
<b>Do you like using past experiences and data to improve upon your workflow and better optimize your day?</b>
<b>Do you regularly wear metaphorical tin-foil hats all day and/or night?</b>


If you answered yes to at least one of those questions, Trackr from SDProductions may be for you. Data these days is important, and many people dislike having services online use their data to sell to advertisers or for malicious intent. But for something like a time management application, you'd be hard-pressed to find one that doesn't require you to sign up and agree to lengthy legal documents that say who-knows-what, not to mention interlinking web apps with their desktop ones.

Trackr aims to change that. After your initial install, Trackr does not initiate any more network connections outside of your local computer - this means that all the data you put in, stays there and never gets transmitted. It features an easy-to-learn and easy-to-use interface, allowing quick set-ups and minimal frustration. Great, right?

Trackr's design is split into three main parts, the "Header" area for starting an activity, the "Activities" area for viewing a brief summary of each activities' most important information, and the "Expanded Info" area (minimized to maintain a compact footprint by default) to reveal more detailed information on a specific activity, such as start and end times, notes and tags, specific projects attributed to the activity, and more.

While we do have an almost entirely functional alpha stage of Trackr, keep in mind it is still in development and certain design aspects are subject to change without notice. Some core features are still non-existent - mainly saving and exporting data to a file as well as any on-board data analysis function. Please do contact me with suggestions as they are much appreciated.
